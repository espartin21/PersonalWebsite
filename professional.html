                        Technical Experience
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I currently work at Expero as a Student Programmer where I have gotten my first taste of
                        industry experience. This has allowed me to develop my technical skills in a fast-paced
                        professional environment where I work with popular in-demand technologies such as: AWS Lambda,
                        Azure CosmosDB, <a href="https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-enterprise-graph">DSE
                            Graph</a>, Neo4j, Serverless Framework, C# .NET Framework, Java, and more. Being a part of
                        Expero has allowed me to not only work under great developers, but have excellent mentorship as
                        well with people who have helped guide me with excellent technical and professional career
                        advice. In my non-technical experience, I worked as an Intramural Basketball Referee for the <a
                            href="https://recsports.tamu.edu/">Department of Rec Sports at Texas A&M University.</a>
                        Here I was able to develop my skills of being a quick thinker and learning to be confident in
                        snap decisions based off the calls I would make in a game. I was also able to learn how to have
                        effective non-verbal communication with the other referees that would be on the court with me.

                    <p>
                        My technical projects in computer science have involved redesigning an internal time tracking
                        tool built with AWS Lambda to utilize the Serverless Framework in order to automate and simplify
                        deployment. My other project started as an internal project to help our clients choose which
                        graph engine best suits their use case. Midway through the summer, a company contacted us saying
                        that they were interested in the work I was doing. Thus my project has gone full time with a
                        whole team to support it. The current project has been to gather metrics on the load times,
                        OLTP, and OLAP cases for Neo4j, DSE Graph, and Azure CosmosDB. Working with a full team on a
                        billable project has been an invaluable experience that has really allowed me to really take a
                        peak into the world of professional technical consulting. <br><br><br>
